# Henry: a children's game
## JS Project Proposal: Henry game simulator
### Background
Henry is a memory game using sound instead of images. The original game is on a 4x4 grid and has the option for practice, single, and multi-person play. Each cell on the grid corresponds with a randomized sound. When the game is in play, the player plays the next sound in the queue and attempts to locate that same sound on the grid. When a matching sound is found, the cell lights up. The game ends when a player matches 4 sounds in a line, either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
To start the game, the player must first choose their setting: practice, single, or multiplayer. Players must press the “start” button, which shuffles the sounds in the grid. On each turn, a player will hit the “Henry” button, which plays the sound the player must locate. For multiplayer games, each player gets one guess before the end of their turn.
